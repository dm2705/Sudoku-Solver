**# Sudoku-Solver**

This program is a simple implementation of the backtracking algorithm which enables a user to input any 9x9 sudoku board and recieve a solution within seconds.
The python code can be found in the SudokuSolver.py file.

Just for clarification, the 0's on the board represent empty spaces which the algorithm aims to solve by backtracking as mentioned above.
